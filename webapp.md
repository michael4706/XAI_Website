    <p>
        Due to limitations of using free tier on hosting platforms, we were not able to deploy the backend of our application. To view a static conceptual site (with a default image), you can visit <a href="https://nicole9925.github.io/facial-analysis-frontend/">here</a>. Please visit this <a href = "https://github.com/nicole9925/facial-analysis-webapp">our github repository</a> to locally run our web application with full functionality. The instructions to run are listed in the readme. 
    <br>
        Nonetheless, our application is fully deployable upon upgrading your heroku account. If you would like to deploy it,, please visit <a href = "https://github.com/nicole9925/facial-analysis-frontend">frontend</a> and <a href = "https://github.com/nicole9925/facial-analysis-backend">backend</a> repositories on GitHub for more information.
